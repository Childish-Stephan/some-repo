# About
This is a singleplayer platformer game in Godot. This was intended to be a beginner game that would teach me the fundamentals along the way and is in no means intended to make any money or of any sorts

# Goals for September:
  * ~~Fix issue with option menu not redirecting back to the previous scene~~
  * Add 3 levels with a new mechanic
  * Completely replace "Animated Sprite2D" node with "Animation Player" and "Animation Tree" node
  * Implement health and damage into the game
  * Add a "Game Over" menu when dying
  * Add "Credits" to main menu
  * Add debug version
  * ~~Publish inital build onto Itch.io~~
